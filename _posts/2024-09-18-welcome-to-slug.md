We're excited to announce the launch of the Stockholm Lean User Group (SLUG) website!

## What's SLUG About?

SLUG is a community for anyone interested in the [Lean theorem prover](https://lean-lang.org/) and formal mathematics in the Stockholm area and beyond. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced user, you're welcome to join our community.

## What is Lean?

Lean is a modern theorem prover and functional programming language that's revolutionizing how we approach formal mathematics. It allows you to:

- Write mathematical proofs that are mechanically verified
- Build on a vast library of formalized mathematics (Mathlib)
- Learn formal methods in an interactive environment
- Contribute to cutting-edge research in formal verification

## Getting Involved

We're planning to organize:

- **Regular meetings** to discuss Lean developments and share projects
- **Workshops** for beginners to learn the basics
- **Collaborative projects** to formalize interesting mathematics
- **Study groups** for reading papers and textbooks

## Community Projects

Our members are already working on exciting formalization projects:

- **Category Theory**: Fibred categories, displayed categories, and polynomial functors
- **Higher Categories**: Groupoid models and higher-categorical structures  
- **Educational Resources**: Proof laboratories and course materials

## Join the Conversation

Ready to get started with Lean or want to connect with fellow enthusiasts? Here's how:

1. **Try Lean online** at [live.lean-lang.org](https://live.lean-lang.org/)
2. **Join the community** at [Lean Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/)
3. **Explore our resources** page for learning materials
4. **Check out member projects** linked from our homepage

## Looking Ahead

We're excited about the future of formal mathematics and Lean's role in it. From the recent successes in formalizing complex mathematical results to its growing use in education, Lean is opening new possibilities for mathematical research and pedagogy.

Stay tuned for announcements about our first official meeting and upcoming events!
