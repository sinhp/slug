# About the Stockholm Lean User Group

The Stockholm Lean User Group (SLUG) is a community dedicated to exploring and advancing the use of the Lean theorem prover and formal mathematics in the Stockholm area and beyond.

## What is Lean?

Lean is a modern theorem prover and functional programming language developed by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research. It combines:

- **Interactive theorem proving**: Write mathematical proofs that are mechanically verified
- **Functional programming**: A powerful programming language with dependent types
- **Mathematical library**: Extensive formalization of mathematics through Mathlib
- **Educational tool**: Increasingly used in mathematics education

## Our Mission

SLUG aims to:

- Foster a community of Lean users in Stockholm and Sweden
- Share knowledge and best practices in formal mathematics
- Organize workshops, talks, and collaborative projects
- Support newcomers learning Lean and formal verification
- Connect with the broader international Lean community

## Community Projects

Our members are actively working on various formalization projects in Lean 4, including:

- **Category Theory**: Formalizations of fibred categories, displayed categories, and polynomial functors
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Groupoid models and higher-categorical structures
- **Education**: Course materials and proof laboratories for teaching formal methods

## Join Us

Whether you're a mathematician, computer scientist, student, or simply curious about formal verification, you're welcome to join SLUG! We welcome all levels of experience, from complete beginners to advanced users.

## History

SLUG was established to create a local hub for the growing international Lean community. The group draws inspiration from similar user groups around the world and aims to contribute to the advancement of formal mathematics.
